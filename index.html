    <strong>Introduction:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk531727184">
        For our project we are examining Major League Baseball statistics from
        2014-2015 that were sourced from <u>Kaggle.com</u>. We will be
        investigating correlations between teams wins while considering other
        variables. The resources we are using to examine the data are Tableau
        and Excel. This is to assist in visualizing the data using graphs and
        charts, as well as performing regression analysis on the data set.
    </a>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Purpose:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of our project is to compare our dependent variable which is
    wins and compare them against other variables, such as attendance and runs
    allowed. We also want to find out if other variables have an effect on
    wins. Our goal as we examined this dataset ultimately is to figure out what
    variables have an impact on wins. We will determine our goals by utilizing
    graphs, statistical measures, regression, and hypothesis testing.
    Furthermore, we will analyze the various results of the visuals and the
    statistical analyses to determine our overall recommendations and
    conclusions on how teams are winning, how to increase team’s overall wins,
    and teams’ popularities
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Description of the Dataset:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As stated above, our dataset is comprised of multiple stats from major
    league baseball teams during 2014 and 2015. The dataset we will be
    analyzing has a total of 48 variables. We found it easier to divide the
    variables into offensive and defensive statistics. The offensive variables
    we thought would have the most potential effect on wins are: hits, 2b, 3b,
    and homeruns. Hits are described as how often a team hits the ball and gets
    on base. We are using the abbreviations 2b and 3b to describe doubles and
    triples, which is how often a team gets a hit and makes it to second and
    third base respectively. It would make sense that these variables have a
    strong impact on wins because a team should be more likely to win if they
    have more opportunities on base, which may lead to more runs scored.
</p>
<p>
    The defensive variables we thought would have the most effect on wins are
    hits allowed, runs allowed, and earned runs. If a team has a high number of
    hits allowed and a low number of earned runs, then we believe that the team
    would have a high number of wins. We also hypothesized that if a team does
    not allow many hits, walks, and runs, then they would have a better chance
    of winning more often.
</p>
<p>
    We did an initial analysis of descriptive measures for team wins in each of
    the years. The table can be seen below. We found that wins are normally
    distributed with a slight positive skewed and a wide degree of dispersion
    (kurtosis). Mean, standard deviation, and variance do not seem to differ
    too much from year to year.

    <strong>Possible Relationships for Wins:</strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The baseball team data for years 2014 and 2015 have various variables that
    could potentially correlate with team/franchise wins, such as different
    types of hits, overall hits, hits allowed, and many more. However, not all
    the variables within this dataset fit our overall goals and purposes. For
    example, the dataset contains repetitive nominal data that are qualitative,
    such as variables for franchise, team, and retro. Therefore, sticking with
    variables and attributes that are numerical and discrete will allows us to
    further our analyses on different impactors of team/franchise wins. In
    addition, to fit the scope of the project, we will be correlating 5
    different variables for wins. We will begin with comparing offensive
    variables/stats of different teams to see if there is actual statistical
    evidence that shows the reason why teams are winning. A great variable to
    begin with would be the total hits of each team. Through hypothesis
    testing, if there is a linear relationship that appears for hits and wins,
    then we will further our analysis on different types of hits; such as
    double hits, triple hits, and homeruns. The next goal for our analysis will
    be to investigate defensive variables/stats. We will instigate hits allowed
    and then further our analysis with other defensive variables/stats, such as
    runs allowed and earned runs. Lastly, we will determine if there is any
    relation between overall attendance and wins.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Descriptive Statistical Analysis:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Each variable correlation for wins that will be covered will explain and
    show linear regression hypothesis testing through tools in Excel. Utilizing
    scatter charts with linear trend lines and the regression/ANOVA tool for
    R-squared and p-value identification will demonstrate and determine the
    results of our overall analysis of impactors for wins. Furthermore, we will
    be assuming that the null hypothesis (H0: ß1 = 0) for the linear regression
    stays true for all variable comparisons for wins, while rejecting the
    alternative hypothesis (H1: ß1 ? 0).

    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Analyzing the scatter chart and the regression/ANOVA output shows there to
    be an extremely weak linear relationship if any at all. The R-squared in
    the summary output shows to be at .0288, which is extremely low when
    comparing the 0-1 scale for R-squared. This shows that the goodness-of-fit
    is extremely poor, with almost no variability of the response data around
    its mean. Also, an example from the dataset shows that in year 2014,
    Seattle Mariners had 87 wins and 1328 hits while Tampa Bay Rays had 77 wins
    and 1361 hits. There are many other teams with similar outcomes and this
    shows why the goodness-of-fit is poor. This also shows why offensive
    variables/stats are a bad predictor and impactor for wins as many other
    similar variables have the same outcomes. Next, the p-value (Significance
    F) is surprisingly high. The p-value is at .1951, which is significantly
    higher than .05. When checking the p-value for the hypothesis testing, 1951
    &lt; .05 is not true, therefore the null hypothesis is not rejected. The
    alternative shows to be not true, and then therefore, there is not a linear
    relationship between hits and wins. Ultimately, this shows offensive
    variables/stats of different teams have little to no impact when it comes
    to wins. This information also shows that there’s no reason to further our
    analysis with other offensive variables/stats, such as double hits, triples
    hits, and home-runs since the variables/stats have a high variability. For
    a double hits example, in year 2014, the Baltimore Orioles had 264 double
    hits and 96 wins while the San Diego Padres had 260 double hits with 74
    wins. Triple hits and home-runs also have similar outcomes.

    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The first defensive variable/stat shows there to be a negative linear
    relationship with y = -0.0724x + 182.05. This result makes sense because
    teams with higher number of wins allow less hits for the opposing team. For
    example, in year 2015, the St. Louis Cardinals had 100 wins with only 1359
    hits allowed. Also, in the same year the Philadelphia Phillies had the
    highest hits allowed at 1592 with 63 wins. They happen to be the team with
    the lowest number of wins throughout the MLB. Furthermore, this
    demonstration has a decent goodness-of-fit since the R-squared is at .3488
    and shows that some variability of the response is around its mean. Next,
    the p-value is shown to be extremely low and is evidently under .05.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected and shows that there is an
    existing linear relationship between these variables. Having an adequate
    goodness-to-fit and proof of significance of there being a linear
    relationship shows that hits allowed for teams is a good predictor and
    impactor for overall wins in the MLB.

    <strong>
     <img src="runsallowedwins1.png" alt="baseball" height="500" width="700">
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This statistical analysis is similar to Hits Allowed Vs. Wins as it’s
    another negative linear regression (y = -0.1047x + 151.47). A team with
    lower runs allowed tend to win more baseball games. This regression has
    another decently high R-squared, which is at .573. The trend line in the
    scatter chart demonstrates that this statistical test has a good fit with
    the wins and runs allowed. The p-value in this demonstration is also well
    below .05. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected and shows that there
    is an existing linear relationship between these variables. Lastly, the
    goodness-of-fit and acceptance of the alternative hypothesis shows that
    this demonstration is a good predictor for wins.
</p>

    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Clarification of what earned runs are: It’s any run that scored against a
    pitcher without the benefit of an error, so therefore it’s a defensive
    variable/stat. Once again, the linear equation is negative (y = -5.2276x +
    1043). All defensive variables/stats should be negatively linear due to the
    dependent and independent variables having an inverse relationship between
    the two. This last statistical test for defensive variables/stats also
    shows to have a goodness-of-fit due to the R-squared being .5562.
    Ultimately, Runs Allowed Vs. Wins and Earned Runs Vs. Wins show to have a
    lot of variability of the response data around its mean. Also, the p-value
    for this test is once again significantly below .05, then therefore we
    reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that shows
    there’s a linear relationship between the two variables. Earned runs shows
    to be a good predictor due to a high R-squared and proven linear regression
    through hypothesis testing.

    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The last statistical analysis that is looked at is Attendance Vs. Wins. The
    R-squared in this test also seems to be low, which has evidently impacted
    the goodness-to-fit for the graph. Next, the p-value for this example is
    significantly low and below .05. The null hypothesis is once again
    rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is approved and therefore is shown
    to have significance and a linear relationship. By looking at the
    evidential information, attendance for a ballpark does increase with higher
    number of wins in a franchise.

    <strong>Recommendations:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Baseball teams can be split into two separate categories; offense and
    defense. For our analysis the focus was on which is more important to earn
    wins for the team. Does having a weak defense but a strong offense offer a
    better chance at winning more games, or does a strong defense but a weak
    offense offer a better opportunity? In this section we are focusing on the
    offensive stats recommendation, the defensive stats recommendations and
    then the most important non-game stat for teams, the attendance for the
    games.
</p>
<p>
    Our analysis found that there is no significant relationship amongst hits
    and wins. Furthermore, if there was conclusive evidence, then there’s an
    extremely weak goodness-of-fit that shows to be extremely poor with no
    variability. As mentioned earlier, in 2014, the Rays got 33 more hits
    during the season over the Mariners (the Mariners had 10 more wins). This
    shows that recommendations for teams do not concentrate solely on hits as
    they do not, at least statistically, mean a greater chance of winning. The
    reason that the other offensive variables vs wins wasn’t included was
    because they didn’t have a significant enough impact on the data.
</p>
<p>
    Having a strong offense that includes hits, 1B, 2B, 3B, and runs does not
    mean a team can always win as there is not a high correlation between them
    as visualized below. Also, we noticed that the top three and bottom three
    teams with the highest hits in 2014 and 2015 did not necessarily have the
    highest or lowest number of wins. For example, STL had the highest number
    of wins in 2015 but did not have the highest number of hits (1,368). In the
    same year, CIN having one of the lowest number of wins managed to have more
    hits than STL. This furthers the strengthening of the fact that a strong
    offense doesn’t necessarily make teams win, rather both a strong defense
    coupled with a strong offense will better their chances.

</p>
<p>
    Getting more runs than the other team is how you win in a game of baseball,
    one method to achieve that is to prevent the other team from scoring. The
    stats that were analyzed for the defense of the MLB teams include
    regression analysis of Hits allowed vs Wins, Runs allowed vs Wins, and Runs
    Earned vs Wins. Comparing the three based from R-squared shows that the
    strongest is the Runs Allowed vs Wins. This analysis makes sense as the
    less runs you give up the more likely you are to win, this applies to both
    teams in the same game though. Some recommendations to make for teams to
    help prevent Runs allowed would include focusing less on pitching and more
    on infield play, devoting extra practice time to preventing the number of
    allowed bases per hit, and to focus on preventing steals and walks.
</p>
<p>
    While the prevention of hits is important to preventing overall scores, the
    likelihood of a no-hit game based off the data we had would be 0.25%.
    Therefore, teams shouldn’t be focusing on allowing no hits during a game,
    but rather to prevent the players that do hit from scoring. This can be
    achieved by focusing less on pitching perfect games and more on the infield
    and outfield play. The number of runs could potentially be greatly cut down
    if teams increase the time and money spent on their training of inner field
    play, as well as outfield play. With that said, improved pitching is still
    a great benefactor for increased wins for a team. Another key point to
    focus on rather than keeping down runs is to prevent the runner from making
    it past first base. Lastly, the number of hits doesn’t include walks, but
    walks can lead to scores depending on other hits and steals from the team.
    While a team might not strike out, the number of players aiming to score
    can be cut down by the prevention of walks.
</p>
<p>
    In reference to the graph below, you can see that the defensive variables
    (Hits allowed, Runs Allowed, Earned Runs) are incredibly important for
    increasing wins for MLB teams. The top 3 teams based on wins had on average
    200 less hits, allowed as well as 200 less runs throughout the season.
</p>
<p>
   <center> <img src="top 3 teams1.png" alt="baseball" height="500" width="700"> </center>
</p>
<p>
    While winning is the most important statistic for the team, revenue is the
    most important aspect for the owners of the teams. A big contribution
    towards revenue is brought in by the game tickets, concessions, and on-site
    merchandise. The amount of revenue brought in is affected by the number of
    fans attending the games throughout the season. While most of the research
    and analysis completed was focused on how teams are more likely to earn
    wins. There was also regression analysis done on whether attendance
    affected the number of wins. The R-squared at a mere 0.19 showed that there
    wasn’t a strong linear regression between the two variables. This means
    that getting more wins throughout the season doesn’t guarantee of increased
    attendance. The in-game statistics do not have a correlation with
    attendance, so instead, companies should focus more on advertisement,
    offering discounts or deals, or to expand on the number of seats if they’re
    reaching capacity to ensure more seats are available for fans.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
    <strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    An initial analysis of the set of MLB data found that Wins were normally
    distributed with a slight positive skew and wide degree of dispersion,
    mean, standard deviation, and variance that showed to differ from year to
    year. A thorough analysis of the data set allowed us to determine impactors
    for our dependent variable (wins) from the selected independent variables
    (Hits, Hits Allowed, Runs Allowed, Earned Runs, and Attendance). The
    analysis showed that the variables that lead towards runs (Hits, 1B, 2B,
    3B, Home runs, etc.) were not as statistically correlated to getting wins
    as the variables that lead to preventing runs (Hits Allowed, Runs Allowed,
    Earned Runs). For this process, the data was utilized through a linear
    regression within Excel to find trend lines, R-squared, and p-values.
    Utilizing these statistical measures allowed linear regression hypothesis
    testing that demonstrated when either a linear or a non-linear relationship
    existed. This process allowed analysis and observances of possible
    correlations between wins and our independent variables. Utilizing our
    regression models and hypotheses testing allowed our group to determine
    that the defensive variables such as hits allowed, runs allowed, and earned
    runs allowed would have a great effect on wins while discontinuing our
    statistical analysis on offensive stats due to conclusive evidence for lack
    of correlation. Since the offensive variables aren’t as correlated to wins
    as the defensive variables, our recommendations leaned more towards
    defensive options. Teams should focus more on defensive strategies such as
    earned runs, runs allowed, hits allowed, and prevention since these have
    more of an impact on their chances of winning. This doesn’t mean that teams
    should completely stop working on hitting and running, but these additional
    resources shouldn’t be their main priority to their current routine. At the
    very basic level, teams should focus more on preventing runs first and
    preventing hits second. There are several ways to prevent these, including
    focusing on infield play, fly ball catches, preventing walks, and limiting
    the number of bases earned by hits.
</p>
<p>
    Team owners have two primary areas to focus on, their teams getting wins,
    and making money. We have already covered what to do to achieve more wins,
    but how can an owner make their team more profitable. A statistic provided
    by our data set included the yearly attendance for each team. Through
    analysis we found that the R-squared for attendance vs wins was weak at
    .19. If a team’s winning does not improve the attendance, then what would?
    We recommended that team owners focus on either improving the amount made
    during a ballgame by concessions and merchandise sales or to focus on
    outside factors to draw a larger crowd.

<h1><b>Purpose:</b></h1>

<p>Our purpose of the project is to elaborate and visualize different variables of the commodity animal trade statistics. Deeply explore the attributes/variables within our dataset to make clear conclusions on the relationships between these attributes/variables. Additionally, we have selected 6 countries within the dataset (at random) for our analysis. We will view trade flow (imports &amp; exports), trade value (USD), each trade’s weight, quantity of each trade, and the commodity being traded of each of the 6 countries selected from 2006-2016. This will provide us with 10 years of valuable trade statistics for which we can analyze both contextually and visually. </p>

<p>The 6 countries we have selected for analysis are: Australia (Australia), Brazil (South America), Canada (North America), China (Asia), Denmark(Europe) &amp; Egypt (Africa). We selected these countries because we intended to select a country from each of the 7 continents. However, our dataset does not have trade information for the entire continent of Antarctica since there are no trade normality’s. Our analysis will be demonstrated with the utilization of Tableau using the many visualization tools available, such as: bar charts, line charts, pie charts, a table, geographic map, and a heat map. After our visual analysis has been completed for each of the 6 countries selected a conclusion will be made on the rankings of the 6 countries based on their trade (live animals) habits from 2006-2016.</p>

<h1><b>Background Information:</b></h1>

<p><b>Trade Commodity Dataset</b></p>

<p>The dataset that we chose for this project focuses on commodity animal trade. This data set was chosen because we thought that it would be interesting to see the differences among countries and continents when it comes to the trade of live animals and which countries or continents exported the most animals and which countries were the ones who were importing the most due to the demand within the country. Within the dataset that we have chosen, there are 10 variables: country_or_area, year, comm_code, commodity, flow, trade_usd, weight_kg, quantity_name, quantity, and category. All of these variables will be useful to us later when we start to explore and create the visualizations. Country_or_area is defined as the country name of record and it is a categorical variable which we will use in a geographical role as country/region. As mentioned above we will be looking at 6 different countries that we selected at random. The next variable that we have year. The dataset defines year as “the year in which the trade has taken place”, basically the dataset looked at all of the imports and exports of animals within the given country and the last time that specific product was imported or exported is going to show up as the year within the dataset. Year will be a categorical variable as well and the data type is date. Comm_code is a unique number given to the individual exports and imports of each country based on the specific animals that they are importing and exporting, this variable is a categorical variable. The next variable that we have is commodity, this tells us what exactly each country was importing and exporting. Commodity is a categorical variable. Flow defines whether the country imports or exports a certain commodity and it is a categorical variable. Trade_usd is a quantitative measure for the amount spent on the import and export of a specific commodity. This measure will be used in average to see the average amount spent on imports and exports within the particular country. We will use this variable in currency with 0 decimal places. Weight_kg is also a quantitative measure that we will use in average. The weight_kg is a measure of the total weight of the commodity that the country has imported or exported. The next measure that we have is quantity_name, which is correlated to the quantity because it explains what type of variable is being used to calculate the total quantity. Quantity_name is a categorical measure. Like previously mentioned, quantity is a measure of the amount of imports or exports the country has traded. Quantity is based on quantity_name and the quantity is a quantitative measure that will be used in average. The final measure that we have is category. This measure is correlated to the commodity that the country imports or exports. The category is a categorical variable. Another correlation that we saw in this data set is between quantity and trade_usd. It seemed as though the higher the quantity average, the higher the trade_usd average would be. More of these correlations will be explained later within this report and the visualizations will help show the correlations between the data.</p>

<h1><b>Visualizations &amp; Findings:</b></h1>

<center><p><b>Visualization 1: Geographic Map</b></p>
<img src="geomap.png" alt="trade" height="500" width="700"></center>

<p>For our first visualization we decided to use a geographic map for our analysis. This geographic map allows for a perfect illustration of each of the 6 countries (and continents). When analyzing trade commodity data, we felt it was very necessary to provide an image of all of the countries and where they are located around each other. Additionally, this illustration contains the average trade value (in USD) for all of the 6 countries from 2006-2016. Per the visualization, the countries with the highest average trade value (in USD) are as follows: Australia ($69,842,992), Canada ($54,983,846), Denmark ($44,090,431), China ($39,898,238), Brazil ($24,840,333), and Egypt ($6,829,363). The main goal of this visualization was to give a geographic and locational view of all of the countries in our analysis as well as displaying one of if not the most important attribute in our data, Trade value (USD), to show how the countries ranked based on that attribute. It is very clear that Australia earned the most trade value throughout the ten-year period.</p>

<center><p><b>Visualization 2: Bar Chart</b></p>
<img src="barchart.png" alt="trade" height="500" width="700"></center>
<p>We decided to use a bar chart for this demonstration to show what the top commodity for trade USD is within the six countries/continents that we decided to analyze. Utilizing a bar chart for this visual was most fitting and practical for the purpose since we wanted to show what the top commodity is with the six different countries. Ultimately, we wanted to compare different variables as a whole while applying a year filter range of 2006-2016. Originally this visualization showed all the commodities that are traded with different countries. For example, if we get rid of the top commodity filter the visualization will drill up and show all the other commodities. Essentially, we drilled down to show what the top commodity is with the six countries that are within the continents. Furthermore, this showed a clear visual over the 10 years on which country has the highest average USD trade dollars for the top trade commodity. Canada through 2006-2010 had the highest average trade USD for the top commodity (Bovine animals, live, except pure-bred breeding), however Australia was rapidly increasing their average trade USD ($433,622,242) and eventually surpassed Canada in 2011 and maintained to be the highest average trade USD country among the six countries to be studied.</p>

<center><p><b>Visualization 3: Bar Chart</b></p>
<img src="barchart1.png" alt="trade" height="500" width="700"></center>
<p>It was very clear from our previous two visualizations that Australia was quickly becoming the top ranked country out of the 6 countries chosen for our analysis on trade from 2006-2016. This visualization was made to dive deeper into Australia specifically and try and gather more information as to why they were the top trade player during the ten-year period. This bar chart contains Avg. Quantity (blue), Avg. Trade USD (red), and Avg. Weight Kg. (orange) for each trade commodity for the country of Australia. Per the visualization it is clear the top commodity sought after by Australia during this ten-year trade period was “Bovine Animals, Live, except pure breeding”. This commodity had an Avg. Quantity of 832,841, an Avg. Trade USD of $569,968,408 and an Avg. Weight Kg. of 279,667,000. Other notable commodities sought after by Australia include: “Bovine Animals, live pure-breeding” and “Sheep, Live”.</p>

<center><p><b>Visualization 4: Table</b></p>
<img src="tables.png" alt="trade" height="500" width="700"></center>
<p>For this visual we wanted to make a table to demonstrate the six countries that utilize the different type of flows, such as export, import, re-export, re-import. Also, applying average quantity, average trade USD, and average weight kg furthers the analysis and purpose of the table. The table does a good job demonstrating what country has the highest flow requisite within average quantity, average trade USD, and average weight kg. For example, looking at export, China has the highest average quantity (22,539,438) while Egypt has the lowest (33,886). This visualization also shows what countries aren’t included in certain flows, such as re-export and re-import. By analyzing the first flow, export, Canada has the lowest average quantity (1,683,579) and the highest average weight kg (65,975,344). This makes sense as Canada’s top trade commodity are bovine which are large/heavy animals. Therefore, explaining why Canada’s exporting average quantity is low when comparing to Canada’s high exporting average weight kg. Over the 10 years for importing the six countries growth increases at a normal rate except China. China’s average trade USD increased immensely when compared to the other countries. In 2006 China’s trade USD was $7,051,206 and in 2016 it’s at $38,152,604. This shows that China has the most interest for importing among the six countries. This table also demonstrates that Canada is the only country that re-exports and only four countries re-import (Australia, Brazil, Canada, and China).</p>

<center><p><b>Visualization 5: Bar Chart</b></p>
<img src="barchart2.png" alt="trade" height="500" width="700"></center>
<p>This visualization utilizes a column chart. Ultimately, a column chart was used to demonstrate three values (average quantity, average trade USD, and average weight kg) that shows a comparison for each of the six countries with the range of 2006-2016. The chart clearly demonstrates which countries has the highest values among the three over the 10 years. This visual has similar results that are in visualization 2. Canada during 2006-2010 has the average highest trade USD (2006: $54,049,655, 2007: $59,654,259, 2008: $60,912,430, 2009: $53,672,128, 2010: $55,319,363) and average weight kg (2006: 26,239,00, 2007: 33,860,395, 2008: 34,286,891, 2009: 31,091,306, 2010: 29,727,396) . 2011 and onward, Australia shows to be the dominant country with average trade USD (2016: $69,842,992) and average weight kg (2016: 26,564,620). China throughout the 10 years has the highest average quantity (2016: 13,292,192).</p>

<center><p><b>Visualization 6: Heat Map</b></p>
<img src="heatmap.png" alt="trade" height="500" width="700"></center>
<p>The purpose of this visualization is to show the six countries highest average weight kg by the different commodities during the years 2006-2016. Utilizing a heatmap/highlighted table makes the visualization and purpose clear for higher values. Also, utilizing the year slider allows the demonstration to show the overall changes if any for the weight kg values. This visualization provides clear information that Bovine animals, live, except pure-bred breeding over the 10 years are the top contenders for overall weight (2016: 279,667,000) in Australia. This shows that Australia deals the most with this certain commodity since the number is overwhelming higher than every other commodity (weight variation). Also, the same commodity is the top for Brazil (2016: 108,072,177) and Canada (2016: 125,989,846). Furthermore, the 2<sup>nd</sup> (2016: 160,029,305) and 3<sup>rd</sup> (2016: 151,757,978) highest weight within the heatmap/highlight table is Swine, live except pure-bred breeding &gt; 50 kg in China and Denmark.</p>

<center><p><b>Visualization 7: Donut Chart(s)</b></p>
<img src="donut.png" alt="trade" height="500" width="700"></center>
<p>This donut chart visualization was used to illustrate the weight of all commodities for each country during the ten-year period by flow. Flow is the method in which the commodities were transported and categorized (import, export, re-import, re-export). This visualization brings value by showing which commodities each country brought in via their exports and imports by weight. The most sought-after trade commodity was “Bovine animals, live, except pure-bred breeding” which is shown by the cream color in each donut chart. This commodity was the most dominant trade commodity by weight for the following countries: Australia (3,076,337,005 kg), Canada (3,779,695,375 kg), Brazil (2,377,587,884 kg), and Egypt (150,381,985 kg). It is worth noting that again Australia seems to be the leading country in most trade categories during the ten-year period of 2006-2016. Additionally, when the flow filter is changed from “All” to “Re-Export” the only country displayed is Canada and the trade commodity most prevalent is again “Bovine animals, live, except pure-bred breeding”. Re-exports are exports of foreign goods in the same state as previously imported. When the flow filter is changed from “All” to “Re-Import” the countries shown are: Australia, Brazil, Canada, and China. China specifically is interesting with their Re-Import as the only commodity Re-Imported by China was “Animals, live, except farm animals”. Re-Imports are goods imported in the same state as previously exported. For the countries who did Re-Import, Australia mainly re-imported “Horses, live except pure-bred breeding”, Brazil mainly re-imported “Horses, live pure-bred breeding” and Canada mainly re-imported “Bovine animals, live pure-bred breeding”. This visualization is extremely valuable because it provides the ability to analysis each country by viewing their trade commodities and the flow of those commodities from 2006-2016!</p>

<center><p><b>Visualization 8: Motion Chart (Line)</b></p>
<img src="motion.png" alt="trade" height="500" width="700"></center>
<p>We decided to utilize a motion chart for average quantity for the six different countries over 2006-2016. By analyzing the data, we realized that China’s average quantity during 2007-2010 was extremely high (peaked in 2009: 72,845,909) when compared to the other 5 countries. Utilizing a motion chart demonstrates the decreasement and stabilization of commodity quantity over the years for the countries. China decreases even more after 2013 (lowest in 2014: 597,202), while the other 5 are stable over the 10 years. Ultimately, after 2011, the six countries have an overall and similar and stable quantity of trade.</p>

<center><p><b>Visualization 9: Highlighted Table (Calculated Field)</b></p>
<img src="high.png" alt="trade" height="500" width="700"></center>
<p>To further analysis the average quantity of each commodity for each of the 6 countries selected, we decided to make a table showing all commodities that were traded during the ten-year period (2006-2016) with each country’s average quantity of the commodities traded. Instead of just making a simple table for our illustration we felt it was necessary for the table to provide more of an impact and thus we created a calculated field to highlight the entire table. This calculated field highlights the highest (in green) and lowest (in red) average quantity of each in commodity. For example, the first commodity shown, animals, China’s average quantity of 100,951,004 is highlight in green and Brazil’s average quantity of 33,663 is highlighted in red. This table is able to further provide not only quantitative analysis with average quantities, but it also implements a very helpful visual tool in highlighting the highest and lowest average quantities of each commodity to show the commodities that each country prioritized more in trade and those that they did not.</p>

<h1><b>Conclusion:</b></h1>

<p>After analyzing the visualizations, it is clear that Australia is the leading country in terms of trade. Followed by Canada, Denmark, China, Brazil, and finally Egypt. Our visualizations showed that the most traded commodity was livestock (bovine, sheep, swine, etc.) And the countries with a higher ratio of livestock trade tended to have a higher trade value in USD. Egypt and Brazil had the lowest average quantity of each commodity and thus had the lowest trade value. This makes sense as Egypt and Brazil are the lowest ranked countries in average trade, both have lower import and export values than the other countries. </p>

<p>One of the more surprising finds from the visualization was that China was ranked as the third lowest of the six countries in terms of trade. China has become one of the leading economies in the world recently, so we assumed that they would have ranked higher in average trade in dollars. China’s average trade in USD increased much faster than the other five countries, this is most likely due to the massive number of products they were exporting between the years of 2007 and 2009. China has the highest amount of exports of the six countries but still has one of the lowest trade values, this is most likely due to the fact that China's exports do not sell as high per unit as livestock.</p>

<p>As previously stated, livestock is the highest traded commodity of the six countries. Canada was originally the leading country in livestock trade but in the recent years Australia surpassed them. Livestock seems to be the most lucrative world trade commodity, Visualization 7 reaffirms this. Livestock is the highest imported and exported commodity for all countries, and all but China and Denmark have bovine as their most traded livestock good.</p>

<p>Our visualizations showed that for Australia, Canada, Denmark, China, Brazil, and Egypt livestock was the most lucrative trade commodity. It is likely that this trend would be present in other countries as well. Due to this realization, it is highly probable a country could increase their average trade value by exporting more livestock, specifically bovine.</p>
